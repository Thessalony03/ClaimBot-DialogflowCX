2Ô∏è‚É£ Bot collects:
   - Policy ID  
   - Date of Incident  
   - Claim Type  
   - Claim Amount

3Ô∏è‚É£ Bot calls Python webhook ‚Üí checks fraud condition:
   - **If claim ‚â§ ‚Çπ50,000:** Accept and confirm.
   - **If claim > ‚Çπ50,000:** Flag as suspicious, escalate to human.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Session params are tracked in Debug View.
